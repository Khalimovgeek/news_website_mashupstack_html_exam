        <h1>Gold Prices Rise Amid Global Economic Uncertainty</h1>
        <p>
            Gold prices witnessed a noticeable rise in recent 
            days as global economic uncertainty continues to 
            influence investor behavior. Factors such as 
            inflation concerns, fluctuating stock markets, 
            and geopolitical tensions have driven demand 
            for gold as a safe-haven asset.
        </p>
        <p>
            In India, gold prices have also seen an upward trend, 
            impacting both investors and consumers planning purchases 
            for weddings and festivals. Market analysts suggest that 
            prices may remain volatile in the near future, advising 
            buyers to stay informed before making major investment decisions.
